It is different from the Proof of Work (PoW) protocol, which you may have heard of before, because Bitcoin uses PoW. With a decentralised blockchain, these consensus protocols help keep everyone on the same page, so we all know what transactions have been processed and in what order. This is known as validation.</p> <p>ETH2 currently has a Proof of Stake (PoS) chain called the Beacon Chain, which is faster, more energy efficient and more decentralised than PoW. It's powered by users depositing ETH and providing an Ethereum node online 24/7 to perform the required validation. As a reward for providing the node, the Beacon Chain gives node operators additional ETH on top of their deposits. It can be viewed similarly to earning interest in a bank account, with the exception that these rewards are generated in return for helping secure the network.</p> <h3 id="what-does-rocket-pool-do"><a href="#what-does-rocket-pool-do" class="header-anchor">#</a> What does Rocket Pool do?</h3> <p>Rocket Pool is the base layer protocol for decentralised and trustless Ethereum 2.0 staking.</p> <p>Designed to support stakers of all shapes and sizes, Rocket Pool was built with the intent to allow anyone to trustlessly stake as little as <strong>0.01</strong> ETH to a network of decentralised node operators with full autonomy underpinned by RPL collateral (a type of bonding or insurance that ensures good behavior).

Rocket Pool will allow anyone to earn rewards on deposits as small as <strong>0.01 ETH</strong>.</p></li> <li><p>Depositing ETH with the Beacon Chain will also require the user to have knowledge on how to interact with smart contracts. Rocket Pool handles all interactions with the Beacon Chain for you.</p></li> <li><p>Ethereum 2.0 is being rolled out over several phases. Depositing during the early phases 0 or 1 means your deposit is locked until phase 2 arrives, which could be several years. With Rocket Pool you instantly get our rETH token when depositing. This is a tokenised staking deposit which gains rewards over time and doesn't need to be locked with us. It can be traded/sold/held at any time providing our users with liquidity. It can also be traded back to Rocket Pool for ETH plus rewards at any time if there is liquidity available - no need to wait years.</p></li> <li><p>The Beacon Chain will require a user who makes a deposit to be technically proficient at running an Ethereum node 24/7 and keeping that node online and secure. Rocket Pool has a decentralised network of independent Ethereum node operators that provide this service.</p></li> <li><p>The Beacon Chain will penalise users who make a deposit but fail to keep their node online. Rocket Pool socialises any penalties or losses that occur on nodes across the whole network which minimises the effect greatly for any single user.</p></li> <li><p>Some users may be confident in running their own node but do not have the 32 ETH required for the deposit. If they join Rocket Pool's decentralised network of Ethereum node operators, they only need 16 ETH minimum to solo stake. They also get the added benefit of receiving extra income from the network for providing this service which generates a higher ROI than staking solo.</p></li></ul> <h3 id="how-does-it-work"><a href="#how-does-it-work" class="header-anchor">#</a> How does it work?</h3> <p>Hold tight, this is a meaty one! The protocol is primarily composed of 3 main elements, smart contracts, the Smart Node Network and Minipool Validators.</p> <ul><li><p>Our smart contracts accept ETH deposits, assigning them to node operators with staking commission rates based on current node operator demand, and also issue and track various tokens.</p></li> <li><p>Our Smart Node Network is a decentralised network of special Ethereum nodes that run our Smart Node software. They feature custom background processes that allow them to communicate with the protocol's smart contracts, and just as importantly, provide the network consensus (validation) required by the Beacon Chain.</p></li> <li><p>Any user can run one of these Smart Nodes and stake their own ETH fee-free if they have the minimum 16 ETH required. For providing the protocol with a Smart Node, the user also receives extra rewards from the network on top of the rewards they earn staking their own ETH. They earn RPL tokens in return for intially putting up RPL as collateral, insuring or bonding their node against bad behavior or poor performance.</p></li> <li><p>Minipool Validators are another smart contract, but these are worth defining on their own due to being such a key aspect of the protocol. These smart contracts are created by node operators who deposit 16 ETH on their node. When they do this, this smart contract receives 16 ETH in deposits from users who just want to stake but not run a node (rETH stakers). When this contract contains a total of 32 ETH (16 ETH initial deposit plus 16 ETH from rETH stakers), a new validator is created on the node which performs the consensus duties for that deposit to earn staking rewards.

They support everything from institutional capital, to hedge funds, family offices and everything in between.</p> <p>Rocket Pool was designed to support those providers, meaning ETH staked through SaaS solutions can be put to use through Rocket Pool, rather than having to spin up bespoke staking solutions to deal with each client.</p> <p>ETH holders can choose between paying a SaaS provider or being paid to be an operator themselves. With Rocket Pool, SaaS providers and independent operators maximize their return by being paid to run a node, both in ETH and RPL. The protocol allows teams to run their own infrastructure, and use Rocket Pool to trustlessly stake ETH in batches of 16 ETH — putting their capital to work further and earn a larger share of returns.</p> <p>This design means Bison Trails or Gemini could use Rocket Pool the same as a DeFi power user. Simply show up with 16 ETH and you’re treated the same as any other node operator. Rocket Pool’s democratized staking system doesn’t favor any one party, as ETH staked through Rocket Pool always directly supports the network.</p> <p>Rocket Pool’s staked ETH wrapper, rETH, is the purest in DeFi because of the Rocket Pool network being fully distributed and trust-minimised. This makes rETH a natural building block for Etherum and providers of all kinds.</p> <h3 id="what-tokens-does-rocket-pool-use"><a href="#what-tokens-does-rocket-pool-use" class="header-anchor">#</a> What tokens does Rocket Pool use?</h3> <p><strong>RPL — Rocket Pool Protocol Token</strong><br>
RPL is the primary protocol token that will be used in goverance of the protocol and can also be staked on a Rocket Pool node as a form of insurance.</p> <p>When creating a 16 ETH minipool validator in the protocol, a minimum of 10% of that ETH's value must also be staked in RPL as a security promise to the protocol. The insurance promise acts as collatoral, where if the node operator is penalised heavily or slashed and finishes staking with less than 16 ETH, their collateral is sold for ETH via auction to help compensate the protocol for the missing ETH. For providing this insurance promise, the protocol also rewards the node operator with RPL rewards generated by the inflation built into the protocol. The more RPL staked as insurance, up to a maximum of 150% of the staked ETH's value, the more RPL rewards the node operator receives.</p> <p><strong>rETH — Rocket Pool Staking Deposit Token</strong><br>
When a user deposits into the protocol, they will instantly receive the rETH token which represents a tokenised staking deposit and the rewards it gains over time in the Rocket Pool network.</p> <p>This token does not need to be locked within the network and it can be traded, sold or held as the user desires. It also importantly provides Rocket Pool users with liquidity over Phase 0 and 1 of the ETH2 rollout in which any staking deposit is locked until Phase 2, which does not have any set date as yet on the ETH2 rollout map.</p> <p>This token can also be traded back to the protocol for ETH + rewards earned at any time, providing there is sufficient liquidty in the protocol to meet the trade.</p> <h3 id="who-is-making-it"><a href="#who-is-making-it" class="header-anchor">#</a> Who is making it?</h3> <p>Rocket Pool was originally started in <a href="https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-your-new-casper-friendly-ethereum-pos-pool-in-alpha-75709bd19936" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">late 2016 by David Rugendyke<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>, a senior developer with over 18 years commercial experience and a computer science background.</p> <p>In May 2017, an alpha version of the product was released.

Additionally, before the smart contracts are deployed to mainnet they will be fully audited by both Sigma Prime and ConsenSys Diligence, two of the best auditing teams around.</p> <p>Rocket Pool is a decentralised network of node operators. If you are a non-operater staker, your deposit will be allocated to a node operator who will perform Proof of Stake duties. Node operators are required to stake as much ETH as they are assigned. If there is ETH loss due to poor node performance, the operator must first compensate the pool's lost ETH with their original 16 ETH and the loss of RPL. If this does not completely make up for the loss, the rest is spread across the entire network through a reduction in the relative value of rETH, rather than one user taking large losses just due to bad luck that their deposit ended up on a bad node.</p> <p>For example, if a node leaves the network with 28 ETH, the operator retains 12 ETH, the network retains 16 ETH - all loss is on the operator. If a node leaves with 15 ETH, the network retains 16 ETH and the operator makes up the missing 1 ETH through the loss of RPL. If the node leaves with 10 ETH, and there is only 1.6 ETH-worth of RPL from the original bond, the network retains 11.6 ETH, and the loss of 4.4 ETH (16 - 10 + 1.6) is spread across the network.</p> <p>Node operators thus have a large incentive to perform well. Node operators are also incentivised by the protocol to stake as much RPL as insurance as possible, due to additional rewards that are given for providing a bigger safety net should they perform poorly.</p> <h3 id="what-is-a-decentralised-staking-protocol-exactly"><a href="#what-is-a-decentralised-staking-protocol-exactly" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is a decentralised staking protocol exactly?</h3> <p>Rocket Pool is a protocol that contains a decentralised network of node operators.
